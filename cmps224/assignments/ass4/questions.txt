(1) The default parameters in this assignment perform a convolution on a
    4096x4096 input using a 5x5 filter and a 32x32 input tile.

    (a) What are the dimensions of the output tile?

        

    (b) What is the total number of ghost cells for the entire input?

        

(2) Assume we used a rectangular 5x7 filter instead. The convolution is still
    performed on a 4096x4096 input using a 32x32 input tile.

    (a) What are the dimensions of the output tile?

        

    (b) What is the total number of ghost cells for the entire input?
